heist_RogueCompany_brief: "Hello my new friends! I am sure we'll get along just fine. I'll cut straight to the point. The Jackals are backstabbing assholes that left me to die on my last job with them. They took something valuable from me: part of my hacking equipment. It's all packed up in a silver briefcase and I managed to track it down to one of their industrial blocks. I need that briefcase back if I want to do some more mischief. While you are there, why not take some of their loot: Weapons, Coke, Cash, you name it! I'll make sure to make every additional bag worth your time. Cops are already in the area, blocking off streets and preparing for an ambush themselves. I'd suggest you dress accordingly."
heist_RogueCompanyNarr_brief: "You guys have quite the resume. Think you can help me get revenge on my former colleagues in the Jackal street gang? Their industrial block contains loads of valuables, and you get to keep all of it. You in?"

RC_obj_2: "Secure loot"
RC_obj_2_desc: "Collect at least 10 bags worth of loot. This should set them back financially quite a bit."
RC_obj_4A: "Move to the garage underpass"
RC_obj_4a_desc: "The driver can't get any closer, so a new plan is needed. There is a brown unlocked SUV in the garage underpass."
RC_obj_4B: "Move to the side alley"
RC_obj_4b_desc: "The driver can't get any closer, so a new plan is needed. There is a brown unlocked SUV in the side alley."
RC_obj_5A: "Get rid of the ambush!"
RC_obj_5A_desc: "It's a trap! Kill all the pigs before we can proceed further."
RC_obj_5B: "Get rid of the ambush!"

RC_obj_8: "Escape!"
RC_obj_8_desc: "With the stingers out of the way you can now take off with the SUV. It's time to make your escape!"
#Voicelines Main
RC_obj1: "The Jackals are just up ahead. Give them hell!"
RC_obj3: "Now it's time to get the briefcase. Move to the factory block ahead."
RC_obj2: " Time to go after their loot, yeah? 10 bags are enough for my taste, but if you want you can clear them out completely."
RC_obj4A: "That should be enough money for now. With everything in tow it's time to get you out of there. Move to the underground garage. The entrance is by the underpass."
RC_obj4B: "That should be enough money for now. You got everything we need. The heat around the block is too big. Move to the sidealley and wait for further instructions!"
RC_obj5A: "Fuck, Alright, hold out for a bit while I find another extraction plan."
RC_obj5B: "Ah shit! Cops have set up patrols in the area, just hold it a bit!"
RC_obj7: "They've rigged the last possible escape route with stingers. Just remove them!"
RC_obj8: "Spike strips down! Hop into the SUV and get the hell out of there!"
#Voiceline Secondary
RC_Server1: "That's a lot of High-Tech equipment for such low scum. I wonder... what they're up to."
RC_Server2: "Mmmmmh, lots of Server Equipment. Must've been very expensive."
RC_WineCont1: "Look at this! Fuck. I don't have anything at disposal to get the container out though. Guess you must leave it for now."
RC_WineCont2: "Damn, Look at this place, people will pay a fortune to have some of those. You must leave it for now though, there's no way to boost all of it right now."
RC_CokeCont1: "Lots and lots of cocaine. Seems like this thing is supposed to travel all the way to a private island in South America. We should leave it be for now."
RC_CokeCont2: "I guess the jackals are producing an insane amount of cocaine. The container is supposed to travel to a South American island. We should leave our hands away from this until we're done!"
RC_driver: "Ah, schei√üe! I lost signal on my driver! Check the garage entrance and see if he's okay!"
RC_Drones1: "Why the fuck does a random street gang own military grade surveillance drones?"
RC_Drones2: "Titan drones? What is so valuable that they need this kind of surveillance for protection?"
RC_GenSec1: "A GenSec security transport full of equipment? I must give it to them, taking down a bank from within is smart!"
RC_GenSec2: "Look at all the equipment in this truck! They really want to con their way through the vault door. They aren't that dumb after all!"
RC_Gold1: "Gold bars? Doesn't matter where they got it from, it's ours now!"
RC_Gold2: "Gold bullion? This will surely put a dent in their finances!"
RC_GunTruck1: "Look at this, a huge weapon delivery! Probably going out to one of their many other dens. Check if there is anything you can take with you!"
RC_GunTruck2: "Looks like they are shipping out weapons to some other of their bases. So maybe look if there's something you can steal."
RC_KnH1: "Huh, Wait a minute... Kowalski and Hutch? Didn't their offices burn down a while ago?"
RC_KnH2: "Kowalski and Hutch... guess the Jackals built up the company again."
RC_Muscle1: "Is that a longfellow? Guess they love to ride in style!"
RC_Muscle2: "Ah, the longfellow, a beautiful vehicle! Shame it's in the wrong hands!"
