	"heist_RogueCompany_brief" : "Hello my new friends! I am sure we'll get along just fine. I'll cut straight to the point. The Jackals are backstabbing assholes that left me to die on my last job with them. They took something valuable from me: part of my hacking equipment. It's all packed up in a silver briefcase and I managed to track it down to one of their industrial blocks. I need that briefcase back if I want to do some more mischief. While you are there, why not take some of their loot: Weapons, Coke, Cash, you name it! I'll make sure to make every additional bag worth your time. Cops are already in the area, blocking off streets and preparing for an ambush themselves. I'd suggest you dress accordingly.",

	"RC_obj_4a_desc":"The driver will pick you up by the garage exit. Move to the underpass to get to the nearest garage entrance.",
	"RC_obj_6B":"Move to the other alley",
	"RC_obj_4B":"Move to the sidealley",
	"RC_obj_6A":"Move through the maintenance tunnel",
	"RC_obj_6A_desc":"The maintenance tunnel connects this garage with the one across the street which is still under construction. Move through the tunnel, the driver will pick you up at the other garage.",
	"RC_obj_4A":"Move to the garage",
	"RC_obj_8B":"Escape!",
	"heist_RogueCompanyNarr_name":"Rogue Company",
	"RC_obj_4b_desc":"There is too much heat around the block. Move to the side alley for the next best pickup location.",
	"RC_obj__5A_desc":"With the driver dead a new plan is needed. Wait for Yaeger to get a new escape plan!",
	"RC_obj_5B_desc":"The driver can't get any closer, so a new plan is needed. Wait for Yaeger to get a new escape plan!",
	"RC_obj_3":"Retrieve the briefcase",
	"obj_secure_loot_desc":"Collect at least 10 bags worth of loot. This should set them back financially quite a bit.",
	"RC_obj_3_desc":"Retrieve the metal briefcase with the hacking equipment. The GPS tracker on it suggests it's located inside the shipping office over by the container yard.",
	"RC_obj_7B_desc":"The stingers will prevent the SUV from making it past this alley, so you need to clear them!",
	"RC_obj_7B":"Clear the stingers",
	"RC_obj_7A_desc":"The other garage is right ahead. Push through to the escape van!",
	"RC_obj_5B":"Wait for further instructions",
	"RC_obj_7A":"Escape!",
	"RC_obj_2":"Secure 10 bags",
	"RC_obj_5A":"Wait for further instructions",
	"RC_obj_6B_desc":"There is a brown, unlocked SUV in the alley next to the current one. Rush past the fence into the other alley!",
	"heist_RogueCompanyNarr_brief" : "You guys have quite the resume. Think you can help me get revenge on my former colleagues in the Jackal street gang? Their industrial block contains loads of valuables, and you get to keep all of it. You in?",
	"RC_obj_1":"Enter the block",
	"contact_yaeger_name":"Yaeger",
	"RC_obj_1_desc":"Move inside the industrial block to get this show rolling!",
	"RC_obj_8B_desc":"With the stingers out of the way you can now take off with the SUV. It's time to make your escape!",
    "RC_obj1":"The Jackals are just up ahead. Give them hell!",
	"RC_obj2":"Time to go after their loot, yeah? 10 bags are enough for my taste, but if you want you can clear them out completely. The truck is waiting at the end of the factory block ahead.",
    "RC_obj3":"That should be enough money for now. Now it's time to get the briefcase. According to my tracker it's in the shipping office in the container yard.",
    "RC_obj4A":"Alright. With everything in tow it's time to get you out of there. Move to the underground garage. The entrance is by the underpass, near where my driver dropped you off!",
	"RC_obj4B":"Alright. You got everything we need. The heat around the block is too big. Move to the sidealley just across the road from the shipping yard and wait for further instructions!",
	"RC_obj5A":"Fuck, he's dead! Alright, hold out for a bit while I find another extraction plan.",
	"RC_obj5B":"Ah shit! Cops have set up patrols in the area. The driver won't be able to pick you up without being blocked on the way out. Lemme look for an alternative, just hold out for a bit!",
	"RC_obj6A":"Looks like there is way less heat on the other side of the street. There's a tunnel connecting this garage and the garage over there. I'll send another driver there, and you push through!",
	"RC_obj6B":"There's an unlocked vehicle in the alley right next to you. It's the perfect way to get you out of here quick enough!",
	"RC_obj7A":"There's the van! Just jump in and we'll move!",
	"RC_obj7B":"They've rigged the last possible escape route with stingers. Just remove them!",
	"RC_obj8B":"Spike Strips down! Hop into the SUV and get the hell out of there!",
	"RC_Server1":"That's a lot of High-Tech equipment for such low scum. I wonder what they're up to.",
	"RC_Server2":"Mmmmmh, lots of Server Equipment. Must've been very expensive.",
	"RC_WineCont1":"Look at all that valuable WW2 wine. I don't have anything at disposal to get the container out though. Guess you must leave it for now.",
	"RC_WineCont2":"Damn, WW2 wine? People will pay a fortune to have some of those. You must leave it for now though, there's no way to boost all of it.",
	"RC_CokeCont1":"Lots and lots of cocaine. Seems like this thing is supposed to travel all the way to a private island in South America. We should leave it be for now.",
	"RC_CokeCont2":"I guess the jackals are producing an insane amount of cocaine. The container is supposed to travel to a South American island. We should leave our hands away from this until we're done!",
	"RC_driver":"Ah, schei√üe! I lost signal on my driver! Check the garage entrance and see if he's okay!",
	"RC_Drones1":"Why the fuck does a random street gang own military grade surveillance drones?",
	"RC_Drones2":"Titan drones? What is so valuable that they need this kind of surveillance for protection?",
	"RC_GenSec1":"A GenSec security transport full of equipment? I must give it to them, taking down a bank from within is smart!",
	"RC_GenSec2":"Look at all the equipment in this truck! They really want to con their way through to a vault door. They aren't that dumb after all!",
	"RC_Gold1":"Gold bars? Doesn't matter where they stole it from, it's ours now!",
	"RC_Gold2":"Gold bullion? This will surely put a dent in their finances!",
	"RC_GunTruck1":"Look at this, a huge weapon delivery! Probably going out to one of their many other dens. Check if there is anything you can take with you!",
	"RC_GunTruck2":"Looks like they are shipping out weapons to some of their other bases. Maybe look around and see if there's something you can steal.",
	"RC_Hideout1":"Look at this place! Planning board, military grade equipment... even an underground vault! Whoever owns this den, they're planning a strike.",
	"RC_Hideout2":"This lockup is decked out! Look at all this equipment! Maybe they're also planning on revolting against the Jackals, I'll keep them in mind.",
	"RC_KnH1":"Wait a minute... Kowalski and Hutch? Didn't their offices burn down a while ago?",
	"RC_KnH2":"Kowalski and Hutch... guess the Jackals built up the company again.",
	"RC_Muscle1":"Is that a longfellow? Guess they love to ride in style!",
	"RC_Muscle2":"Ah, the longfellow, a beautiful vehicle! Shame it's in the wrong hands!",
